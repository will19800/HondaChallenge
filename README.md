Shop Asia

Our project is a service that allows customers to purchase goods from international companies without needing to pay an exorbitant shipping cost. In addition, we also give customers the ability to purchase from websites that normally do not ship to their address and also support more niche interests. 

• Explain the problem or opportunity you're addressing.
The problem we’re solving is the problem of the high cost of shipping when you purchase items that require international shipping, in addition we’re making it easier to buy from multiple overseas websites and organize group orders.
• Describe your solution and how it works.
The website allows customers to shop as normal, but reduces shipping costs by bundling customer orders in group shipments that are then redistributed once they reach the customer’s local warehouse. This group shipping method also allows us to fill another niche, which is Album Group Orders. Since many bands and groups hold raffles for events based on the number of albums purchased, this can create a lot of waste when fans buy more albums than they want just to get entries. Our automated group orders allows these fans to put their extra albums up for purchase at a discount while still receiving the same amount of event raffle entries, therefore this also benefits fans who just want to get albums for a discounted price.
